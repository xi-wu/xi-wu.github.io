Welcome to my site! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Information Systems & Operations Management](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/economics-and-management/organization/departments/information-systems-and-operations-management) at Tilburg School of Economics and Management.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Business Administration (Concentration: Management Information Systems) in June 2022 from [Fox School of Business](https://www.fox.temple.edu/), [Temple University](https://www.temple.edu/).


My primary research interest is in the area of information economics. The core question that motivates my research is: *How do technologies influence the process by which firms capture and create values?*

In particular, my work tries to understand knowledge creation, innovation, and entrepreneurship in Information Technology (IT) industries. My current research focuses on **digital platforms**, **open-source software**, and **intellectual property in digital age**. My research uses interdisciplinary approaches such as econometrics, analytical modeling, and machine learning.
